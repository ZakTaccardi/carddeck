carddeck
========

A basic Java application that creates a deck of cards, shuffles it, and deals the 52 cards one by one. The 53rd card will be dealt as well, causing an IllegalStateException.

This project must be built with Gradle. I recommend using IntelliJ.

Use 'gradle run' to run the main method of this application.
Use 'gradle test' to run the test methods of this application.
